# SLogo Design: Group 16

Blake Kaplan, Amy Zhao, Annie Tang, David Yang

## Introduction

**Problem:** We are trying to create an IDE that allows users to programmatically describe designs and Turtle movements

**Primary Design Goals:** We are trying to design an IDE that is flexible in both the functions that it provides for the user and the complexity of the commands that the user can input.

**Closed:** The background the logic responsible for each command

**Open:** The commands that can be used and in which combinations

**High Level Description:** The program will repeatedly take in user input as a command string. The program will then parse the command to determine what actions to be undertaken. The program will update the model based on the commands and reflect the changes visually.
