###Team 16

* David Yang, Annie Tang, Blake Kaplan, Amy Zhao

* Time Spent
	* Started February 18th
	* Finished Part 1 March 2nd
	* Finished Part 2 March 12th
	* The project took about 70 hours

* Roles:
	* David + Annie: Front end
	* Amy + Blake: Back end

* We used JavaFX resources, Java 8 documentation, and of course the course website for pertinent information about the project.

* Main.java


* The project requires a couple of resource files for the labeling of GUI elements. It also requires resource files to print Error messages. These are all contained within the source file. In order to display a turtle on the canvas, you need to provide the program with a turtle image within the Image folder, or you can simply use the default one provided on start up. You can also load your own configurations using an XML formatted file. We provided a couple to start that you can base your future XML files on. You can also save your current workspace if you want to continue working on it at some point. 

* Once the program is started, you can go to the help tabs to look at all the available commands for SLogo. Once you type the command into the command line at the bottom of the screen, press run to execute and you should be good to go! You can call previous commands and available commands using the drop down menus on the left hand side of the screen. If you set any variables, they will be displayed on the right hand side of the screen. You can change the value of the variable by clicking on the value and editing it directly on the GUI. There are a number of other settings that you can set using to GUI such as pen up/down, solid/dashed/dotted, and thickness. You can set the animation speed, but the speed doesn't change dramatically. If you want the turtle to instantly execute the commands, set the animation to under 0.5 on the slider. If you want to create additional workspaces, there is a create new tab button that will create new workspaces as tabs along the top. If you want to see the state of any of the turtles on the screen, you can hover your mouse over the turtle and its settings will display.

* The animation of the GUI is not perfect. The different speeds are not dramatically different, and the pen will be drawn first before the turtle starts moving. 

* No extra features

* As a whole, the project was helpful in learning more design principles. We learned about APIs and how to use them effectively to create a better designed project. Being split into separate front end and back end teams helped us learn how to bring together two parrts of the project. We learned how to use the MVC model and continued to reinforce our understanding of inheritance.
