###SLogo Team 16

* David Yang, Annie Tang, Blake Kaplan, Amy Zhao

* Started February 18th, Finish Part 1 March 2nd

* Roles:
	* David + Annie: Front end
	* Amy + Blake: Back end

* We used JavaFX resources, Java 8 documentation, and of course the course website for pertinent information about hte project.

* Main.java

* TestMain.java, many tests are conducted using print statements

*T he project requires a couple of resource files for the labeling of GUI elements. It also requires resource files to print Error messages. These are all contained within the source file. In order to display a turtle on the canvas, you need to provide the program with a turtle image within the Image folder, or you can simply use the default one provided on start up.

* Once the program is started, you can go to the Help Tab to look at all the available commands for SLogo. Once you type the command into the command line at the bottom of the screen, press run to execute and you should be good to go! You can call previous commands and available commands using the drop down menus on the left hand side of the screen. If you set any variables, they will be displayed on the right hand side of the screen. You can change the value of the variable by clicking on the value and editing it directly on the GUI.

* No known bugs, crashes, or problems

* No extra features

* As a whole, the project was helpful in learning more design principles. We learned about APIs and how to use them effectively to create a better designed project. Being split into separate front end and back end teams helped us learn how to bring together two parrts of the project. We learned how to use the MVC model and continued to reinforce our understanding of inheritance.
